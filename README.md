# Hakken: An Anime Recommender System

## Background

Anime refers to hand-drawn and computer generated animation originating from Japan. Anime is characterized by it's unique art style, expressive characters and fantastical themes. Since it's inception in 1920, anime has grown to become internationally popular and has found it's way into popular North American streaming services such as Netflix. 

## What is Hakken?

Hakken is a machine-learning based anime recommendation system. It takes user's ratings of anime they've previously seen and uses them as a basis for generating personalized recommendations.

## Motivation

If Netflix, which already implements a machine-learning based recommendation system, hosts anime on it's platform, why build Hakken? 

The selection of anime available on Netflix is limited. Avid anime fans use Crunchyroll, a subscription based anime streaming service, or KissAnime, a free anime streaming website to access a wider array of anime. However, neither Crunchyroll, nor Kissanime serve up personalized anime recommendations to their users. Thus, the motivation behind creating Hakken was to give users automated, personalized recommendations from a much larger pool of anime.
