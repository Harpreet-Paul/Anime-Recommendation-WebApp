Item bias can be thought of as how much above or below the global average an item tends to get rated on average. More simply, the user bias is a term meant to capture whether or not a user is a tough critic or easy-to-please rater. The item bias is a term mean to capture whether an item is inherently above or below average in quality. \n",

    "The KNN algorithm tries to capture the effects of user-item interactions, i.e. user preferences for certain kinds of items over others, on user ratings. However, such effects are small compared to the influence of item and user biases. In other words, the majority of a user's rating on an item is determined by how inherently tough of a rater that user is and how inherently above or below average in quality an item is, independent of a user's preference or aversion for that kind of item. It is only the extent to which a user's raw rating differs from the predicted baseline rating -- which encapsulates the effects of user and item bias -- that captures how much of a preference or aversion a user has to a particular kind of item. \n",

    "For example, suppose a user rates the anime \"Death Note\" a 9/10. If \"Death Note\" has a global average rating of 9/10, meaning it's univerally liked, and the user's average rating is a 9/10, meaning the user gives high ratings easily, then it wouldn't make sense to conclude this user necessarily has a preference for \"Death Note\"-like shows.\n",

    "Now, suppose a user gave \"Stein's Gate\" a 9/10. If \"Stein's Gate\" only has a global average rating of 7/10 and the user's average rating is only a 7/10, then the fact that the user gave \"Stein's Gate\" a rating above and beyond that which would be predicted from the user and item bias effects alone is indicative of a preference for \"Steins Gate\"-like shows.\n",

    "    * Implicit Feedback\n",
    "        * Item ratings convey explicit feedback on user preferences, but there is also implicit feedback in ratings data which can be harnessed to make recommendations. The implicit feedback is the knowledge of which items the users chose to rate in the first place, regardless of they actually rated (high/low) them. This is because users don't select anime to watch at random; they pick ones they think they will like and avoid ones they think they won't. Therefore, having rated certain items implicitly conveys a preference for similar items and not having rated others implicitly conveys an aversion for items similar to those. There are formulations of the KNN algorithm that incorporate implicit feedback data, which, if implemented, would likely yield better recommedations.  \n",
